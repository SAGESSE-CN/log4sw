/**
 * Levels used for identifying the severity of an event. Levels are organized from most specific to least:
 * <ul>
 * <li>OFF (most specific, no logging)</li>
 * <li>FATAL (most specific, little data)</li>
 * <li>ERROR</li>
 * <li>WARN</li>
 * <li>INFO</li>
 * <li>DEBUG</li>
 * <li>TRACE (least specific, a lot of data)</li>
 * <li>ALL (least specific, all data)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Typically, configuring a level in a filter or on a logger will cause logging events of that level and those that are
 * more specific to pass through the filter. A special level, {@link #ALL}, is guaranteed to capture all levels when
 * used in logging configurations.
